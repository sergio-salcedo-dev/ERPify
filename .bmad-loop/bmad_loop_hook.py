"""Coding-CLI hook relay for bmad-loop. Stdlib only.

Each CLI's hook config registers this script under its native event names
(Claude/Codex: SessionStart/Stop/..., Gemini: AfterAgent for Stop, Copilot:
agentStop for Stop) but always passes the CANONICAL event name as argv[1] — the
orchestrator only ever sees canonical events. Payload keys vary too: snake_case
(claude/codex), conversation_id (cursor), or camelCase (copilot's sessionId/
transcriptPath, agy's conversationId/transcriptPath — protojson encoding); the
field extraction below tries each. agy alone carries no cwd, sending the
workspacePaths list instead. Reads the hook payload
from stdin and writes one event file
into the orchestrator's events directory. No-ops (exit 0) unless the session was
spawned by bmad-loop (detected via env vars set on the tmux window), so
normal interactive sessions are unaffected.

Where that directory is: $BMAD_LOOP_EVENTS_DIR when the orchestrator names one,
else the legacy $BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR/events. The channel moved out of the project
tree in #494 so a branch switch or a worktree mount cannot take a live run's
control plane away, and this script is COPIED into the target project at init
time — so an upgraded orchestrator regularly drives sessions whose installed
copy is this file's older self, which knows only the legacy path. That pairing
is what the orchestrator's own dual poll (signals.SignalWatcher) covers.

$BMAD_LOOP_EVENTS_DIR is deliberately NOT part of the no-op detector above: the
mirror-image skew — an older orchestrator that sets only RUN_DIR/TASK_ID driving
a session whose installed relay is this newer file — must still write its
events, and requiring the new variable would silently stall every one of those
runs instead.

Every event also carries a `lineage` tag (DW-507): "match" when the CLI bmad-loop
launched (the tmux launch records its pid, or its forking shell's, in
$BMAD_LOOP_LAUNCH_PID) fired the hook itself, "mismatch" when something else
in between did — a nested coding CLI started from inside the session inherits
this whole environment, so its hooks reach here too — and "unknown" when that
cannot be read (no /proc, an older orchestrator that sets no launch pid). It
only tags: the event is written either way, and the orchestrator decides what
a mismatch means.

      - the launch chain: any process started within _LAUNCH_SHIM_WINDOW_S of

        and the CLI its child; a node shim's real binary is a child again.

    The events dir is the orchestrator's control plane. A driven session has
    write access to the project, so it could plant `<run_dir>/events` as a
    symlink (or, on Windows, a junction) and redirect — or swallow — the
    completion signal, stalling the run to `session_timeout_min` instead of
    completing. `os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)` `isdir()`-checks THROUGH such a
    link, so the refusal has to come before it. That refusal works on every
    platform.

    Where the platform has them, the create+replace is anchored to a dir_fd
    opened O_NOFOLLOW: every later operation goes through that fd, so a swap
    after the check cannot reach the write. Windows has neither
    O_NOFOLLOW/O_DIRECTORY nor a handle-relative open (`os.supports_dir_fd` is
    empty — dir_fd is implemented with the POSIX `*at` calls), so its fallback
    re-resolves the path and the check-to-write window stays open there. It is
    NARROWED, not closed: the redirect check runs again after the payload is
    written and before it is published, so a swap still in place is refused and
    the temp file removed. Two windows stay open on that path (#494), both
    measured: a swap-and-restore around the create is undetectable from stdlib
    Python, and a swap landing after the second check leaves the path-based
    publish unable to find the temp file it wrote — it either raises or renames
    a file the attacker planted inside the attacker's own directory. Neither
    redirects the payload, and both end where a refusal ends: no event, so the
    run waits out session_timeout_min. That is the same outcome an attacker gets
    for free by leaving a redirect in place, which is refused without any race —
    winning the race buys no capability, which is why the residual is accepted
    rather than chased into ctypes/NtCreateFile inside a stdlib-only relay.

    Mode is 0o600 (narrowed from the umask-derived mode an ordinary `open()`
    produced): only the operator running the loop reads these.
